# 2019_project__Boston_Airbnb_Data_Exploration
-- Exploration on the Boston Airbnb Data

This is a project with a theme of *"becoming a data driven Airbnb host*. We explore the Airbnb data assuming that we are an Airbnb host in Boston. Topics include:

* Descriptive analysis on the listings and the hosts data
* Aspect-opinion analysis on the texts data including decriptions about listings and guests' comments
* Gradient boosting models to predict future earnings using the current information about the listings and the hosts
* Analysis on variables that have large impact on the future earnings
